In this project, I am going to start learning how to do web scraping. I am planning to web scrape iMDB to get info about each movie.  My aim is to collect as much data as possible. This will be a continuous project with the implementation of machine learning and NLP. We will start with machine learning section and try to predict the movie score. Let's get started.
